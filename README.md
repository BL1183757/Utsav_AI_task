# Emotion-Based Event Personalizer AI

This project is created for the **UtsavAi Internship Round 1** as a creative solution to personalize events based on guest emotions.

## Project Idea

The AI system analyzes **mock facial emotion data** of guests during an event to track mood trends and recommends:

- Changes in event schedule (e.g., start DJ earlier if guests get bored)
- What activities cause maximum excitement
- Insights to plan better future events

## Files Included

- `emotion_event_data.csv` – Mock data (Guest ID, Timestamp, Emotion, Activity)
- `Emotion_Personalizer_AI_Notebook.ipynb` – Main notebook with analysis and logic
- `emotion_trend_plot.png` – Visualization of emotion trends

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Mock data (no external APIs used)

## Sample Recommendation Logic

- If boredom peaks after 9 PM → start DJ earlier
- If excitement increases during live band → repeat similar acts
- Emotion dips → schedule snacks/breaks

## Note

No external AI APIs like OpenAI/Gemini were used — all data is simulated.
